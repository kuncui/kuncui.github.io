My name is Kun Cui （/kʰun tsʰui/）. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics, at the University of California - San Diego. My work primarily focuses on A'-movement, particularly relative clauses and tough-constructions. From the perspective of syntax-semantics interface, I use both formal devices and experimental approaches to study the reconstruction and intervention effects in these constructions.

The goal of my research has always been to identify language universals and explain crosslinguistic variations under the Principles and Parameters(P&P) approach. So far, Mandarin and Japanese have been my primary research objects. With collaborators, I have also worked on Korean and Manchu.
