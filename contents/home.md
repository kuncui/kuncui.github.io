My name is Kun Cui （/kʰun tsʰui/）. I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Linguistics in School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. My work primarily focuses on relatives and tough-constructions, which are traditionally considered to derive from Wh-movement. From a typological perspective, the two languages I've been working on so far, Chinese and Japanese, are known for their lack of overt Wh-movement. Therefore, in sense of syntax-semantics interface, I also use formal semantics for proper explanations of these phenomena.

The goal of my research has always been finding out language universals and giving explanations to crosslinguistic variations. I've been learning Japanese since middle school(2012). With collaborators, I have also worked on other East Asian languages, including Korean and Manchu. In addition, I hold strong interests in ergative-absolutive languages, and I'm currently learning Basque.
