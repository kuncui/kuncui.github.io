My name is Kun Cui （/kʰun tsʰui/）. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in linguistics at the School of Humanities, Tsinghua University. My work primarily focuses on the syntax of East Asian languages, particularly relative clause and tough-construction, both traditionally considered to derive from wh-movement. Specifically, I study the properties of noun phrases in these constructions, including reconstruction, intervention effect and their thematic roles. Additionally, I am also interested in Chinese ba-constructions, serial verb constructions and classifiers in both Chinese and Japanese. From a syntax-semantics interface perspective, I use formal semantics to explain these phenomena.

The goal of my research has always been to identify language universals and explain crosslinguistic variations under the principles and parameters approach. I have been learning Japanese since middle school(2012). With collaborators, I have also worked on other East Asian languages, including Korean and Manchu. In addition, I also have strong interest in ergative-absolutive languages, and I'm currently learning Basque.
