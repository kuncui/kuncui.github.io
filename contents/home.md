My name is Kun Cui （/kʰun tsʰui/）. I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Linguistics in School of Humanities at Tsinghua University. I study the syntax of Mandarin Chinese, often in comparison with Japanese. My work primarily focuses on the relatives and tough-constructions. From a typological perspective, these two languages are known for their lack of overt Wh-movement. Therefore, in sense of syntax-semantics interface, I also use formal semantics for proper explanations of these phenomena. The goal of my research has always been finding out language universals and giving explanations to crosslinguistic variations.

I've been learning Japanese since middle school(2012). With collaborators, I have also worked on NPIs in East Asian languages, including Korean and Manchu. In addition, I hold strong interests in ergative-absolutive languages, so I'm currently learning Basque.
